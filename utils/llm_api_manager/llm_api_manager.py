        Create an API connection based on the configuration.

        NOTE: Certain types of APIs will necessarily limit the number of connections that can be made.

                For external APIs, this is the client object for a specific provider e.g. OpenAI. 
                For internal APIs, this is a URL to a local host e.g. Ollama, 
                    or None if the the Model is loaded directly e.g. Transformers.
            - model: The model object for an API. 
                For external APIs, this is the model's name as a string.
                For internal APIs, this can be either the model's name as a string or the model object itself.
            - provider: The provider of the API. Currently supported providers are: 
                Anthropic, Cohere, Ollama, OpenAI, and Transformers.
            - model_type: The type of the model. Currently supported model types are:
