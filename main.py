    Essentially, this is a glorified counter that has access to information on the System's resources.

    Since Python does garbage collection and memory allocation for us, 
        we just need to make sure the program is not using more than the system has access to at any given time.
        Similarly, if there is a limit we put upon a system resource, we need to make sure we do not exceed it.
    
    Finally, this information needs to be transmitted to other parts of the program in a controlled manner.
        This is done by having the manager produce a summary object that can be passed around ever X seconds.

        Instantiate a pool with the given configuration.
        Save for File Paths and API connections, each pool consists of a series of counters. 
           Each counter's upper bound is determined by the maximum values specified in the Configs object. 
           or whatever resources the system has available, whichever is smaller.
           For instance, if the config specifies that the maximum available memory is 1024 MBs, 
           but the system only has 512 MB, then the pool's maximum will only be 512 MBs.
    
        When a Resource object is created, the counter is decremented by the amount of resources 
            that are allocated to the resource.

        When a Resource is consumed by a function, the Pool counter is *not* automatically incremented.
            Instead, the freed resource goes to the Core Resource Manager to be re-allocated to another 
            file in the File Path Queue. If no files in the Queue need that resource, then the resource 
            is returned to the pool, and the Pool's counter is incremented.
            For instance, if the Queue is filled with files that don't require an API connection to convert,
            the connection is returned to the pool and its counter is incremented.

        When a given Pool's counter is at zero, the creation of that Resource will be blocked until resources 
            are returned to the pool, or new Resources are provided by the External Resource Manager, 
            which ever happens sooner. This will have the side-effect of dynamically limiting 
            the number of files that can be processed at any one time.
        
        When a given Pool's counter is at its maximum, returned Resources will be 'thrown away' and the counter 
           remains the same amount. For connections, this means that the connection will be closed (???).

        For API connections, the pool is a traditional connection pool a la MySQL. 
            When a Resource object is created, a Connection is allocated to the Resource.
            When the Resource object is consumed, the connection is returned to the pool.
            If the pool is empty, a new connection is requested from the External Resource Manager 
            and added to the pool.

        API connections are refreshed periodically to ensure that they are still valid.
            This is especially important for loaded models like LLMs.

        NOTE: As a guideline, we should over-allocate resources rather than under-allocate.
            Over-allocating is less efficient, but more robust, since a process is less likely to fail

            - An API connection that is needed by one or more of the functions in order to convert a file.
                As functions are sequential, the API connection is only released after the last function 
                that uses an API connection has been executed.
            - Total system memory (in bytes) necessary to execute the conversion functions.
            - GPU memory (in bytes) necessary to execute the conversion functions. This is primarily
